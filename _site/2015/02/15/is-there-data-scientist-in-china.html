<p>This whole BIG DATA thing has by all means piqued China’s curiosity.</p>

<p>Moreover, many companies across industries in China, especially tech companies are taking action to build their in-house capability to mine their goldmine, and deploying an army with relevant skills is one essential part of it.</p>

<p>Data scientist is probably one of the most significant roles in the this squad.</p>
<ul>
  <li>They provide required not only technical but business expertise</li>
  <li>They lead project to drive measureable changes</li>
  <li>They speak the new language of data, insinuating a more data-driven culture to be</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How does data scientist work in China?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Data Scientist is Not One Guy.</strong> The fact that more and more tech companies in China start to value and use data, has indeed changed how they hire data talents. As a matter of fact, current job market is fully filled with all sorts of data-related positions, but sadly enough, no or very few data scientist.</p>

<p>The truth is, tech companies in China normally would just hire different people who specialize on one or two data skills, say ETL, and he/she is then the go-to guy when it comes to that specific data task.</p>

<p>The occasion where one is able to participate in every step throughout a data project to do whatever have to be done like a data scientist is very rare. In china’s tech companies, <strong>Engineer is engineer, analyst is analyst.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Data Scientist Shouldn’t Be “Dumb”.</strong> Data scientists are special, to a degree because they have access to all the company’s data, and authority to make decisions or are able to directly influence the decision-maker (like stakeholders). In China, usually the case is that you either do not have access to the data, or it is very difficult or time-consuming to obtain the data; the impact is minimum because you cannot reach out to the executives and will not be heard.</p>

<p>Disciplines crossing one another really goes a long way towards the development of data science, and I think in order to garner its full benefits, companies have to trust their people and let them grow to become real data scientists.</p>
