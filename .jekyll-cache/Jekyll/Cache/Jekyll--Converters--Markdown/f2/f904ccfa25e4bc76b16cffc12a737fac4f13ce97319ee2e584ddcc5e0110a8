I"î<p>In the world of finance, profound math is probably of the least concern. Unless impossible, people care to approach  problems in simple ways with a <em>sound logic</em>. Though, finance deals with numbers, we donâ€™t see lines of mathematic equations, or as sophisticated methodology as physics in finance. See <a href="http://www.wallstreetoasis.com/blog/do-i-need-math-for-finance">here</a> how differennt math works out in finance.</p>

<p>The very first time I was exposed to finance, I thought I had no difficulty in <a href="http://www.algebra.com/algebra/homework/Finance/FINANCIAL-FORMULAS-101.lesson">financial equations</a>. The hard part, however, is understanding the essences and making sense of them. Before uncertainty, really is where financial thinking comes to play.
and I start to appreciating the beauty of finance. Here I have created two projects.</p>

<p><img src="/media/img/finance_beauty.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Project 1 is to put aside $1000, naturally it is still $1000 at the end of Year 2; Project 2 represents the scenario where to deposite $1000 in a bank and withdraw in two year with a 5% interest rate. While it is human intuition to be in favor of Project 2, I want to take a deep dive into the decision-making, not just by showing the <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp">NPVs</a> for both projects.</p>

<p>We value the two projects using NPV, however it would be useless (or even impossible to calculate) if we can only take Project 1.<br />
<strong>Takeaway#1</strong>: Value (creation) is relative: e.g., use Project 2 interest <strong>r<sub>2</sub></strong>=0.00 to evaluate Project 1 and vice versa.</p>

<p>People use IRR, cost of capital and interest rate in different financial settings, but they are essentially the same.<br />
<strong>Takeaway#2</strong>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_rate_of_return">Internal rate of return</a> of a Project 2 is its interest rate: i.e., the IRR of Project 2 is <strong>r<sub>2</sub></strong>=0.05, and we plug it into the formula to get the NPV of Project 1.</p>

<p>In finance, it is not shockingly counter intuitive. We spend a lot time and effort to boil down a lot of thinking and working to simple outcomes. It is simplicity that is the beauty of finance.</p>
