I"	<p>Still not a big fan of Virtual Machine (VM), I was trying to set up Hadoop framework on my Mac OS X Mavericks, so the cluster will be pseudo-distributed, single-node. I chose not to touch <a href="http://bit.ly/1erBmDT">Hadoop distributions</a> to have some fun with installation in console. Instead of “playing hardcore”, using package manager like <a href="http://bit.ly/1EuteHH">this</a> with homebrew is very much recommended.</p>

<p>1 . Add a new user account (for security reason) and enable remote login access for it, both can be done in System Preferences, and make sure you have the latest java version.<br />
2 . Switch to the new user, generate a key and pass it to authorized_keys. This step sets up networking that enables SSH to localhost, and you can verify by typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh localhost</code> in the terminal, which should return success.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>su - hadoop
ssh-keygen <span class="nt">-t</span> rsa <span class="nt">-P</span> <span class="s2">""</span>
<span class="nb">cd</span> .ssh
<span class="nb">cat</span> <span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.ssh/id_rsa.pub <span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.ssh/authorized_keys

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>3 . <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curl -o</code> to get the latest Hadoop .tar file from <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop.apache.org</a><br />
4 . Untar the file and change the ownership if necessary
5 . Edit hadoop configuration files (under etc/hadoop/): hadoop-env.sh, core-site.xml, hdfs-site.xml, mapred-site.xml, yarn-site.xml. Make what changes could be somewhat very tricky, and there are a hundred dozens of examples you can find online. If you happend to run into any trouble (like I did), please don’t hesitate to reach out and I am willing to help.<br />
6 . <strike>Change hosts</strike> not necessary under this circumstance.</p>

<p>Once these steps have been done, you can <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> into the hadoop directory, and you will find the bin/ directory and all the executables inside it. Start your cluster, and have fun.</p>

<p>This is a complete Hadoop cluster running on a single machine.</p>
