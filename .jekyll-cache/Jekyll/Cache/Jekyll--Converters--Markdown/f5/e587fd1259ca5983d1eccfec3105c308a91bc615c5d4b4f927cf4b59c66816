I"í<p>Still not a big fan of Virtual Machine (VM), I was trying to set up Hadoop framework on my Mac OS X Mavericks, so the cluster will be pseudo-distributed, single-node. I chose not to touch <a href="http://bit.ly/1erBmDT">Hadoop distributions</a> to have some fun with installation in console. Instead of ‚Äúplaying hardcore‚Äù, using package manager like <a href="http://bit.ly/1EuteHH">this</a> with homebrew is very much recommended.</p>

<p>1 . Add a new user account (for security reason) and enable remote login access for it, both can be done in System Preferences, and make sure you have the latest java version.<br />
2 . Switch to the new user, generate a key and pass it to authorized_keys. This step sets up networking that enables SSH to localhost, and you can verify by typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh localhost</code> in the terminal, which should return success.</p>
