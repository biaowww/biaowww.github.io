My name is Biao Wang. I'm a data scientist in training. After years of exploring (and randomly digging), I arrived at the la la land of data science. In order to develop my skills portfolio to pursu this career, I'm learning as if there were no speed limit. I love business and technology, believing the best chance of my career resides in between.

I currently live in the Silicon Valey, seeking for a data/operations analytics intern/job to translate big data into meaningful business insights and actionable business strategys. My skills set include statistical modeling, machine learning, databases (SQL, Hadoop), and cloud computing. I do programming and as well as support business thinking.
