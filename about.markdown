My name is Biao Wang. I'm a data scientist in training. After years of exploring (and randomly digging), I arrived at the wonderland of data science. In order to develop my skills portfolio to pursu this career, I'm learning as if there were no speed limit. I am fascinated by technology and art, believing they are beauty that merely take on diffrent forms.
