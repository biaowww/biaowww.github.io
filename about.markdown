My name is Biao Wang. I'm a data scientist living in Beijing, solving real-world problems with a data lens to support company's decision-making everyday.
   
I like technology but I hate it if no business thinking is behind;  
I like business but I hate it if no data analytics is presented;  
I like analytics but I hate it if no coding are involved;  
I like coding but I hate it if that is all of the work.  
Then, [data science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) to the rescue. 

My previous work experiences include working with a variety of companies, such as 
[Uber](http://www.uber.com),
[Merck](http://www.merck.com/mrl/), and
[Crown Relocations](http://www.crownrelo.com/).
