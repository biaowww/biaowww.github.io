This whole BIG DATA thing has by all means piqued China's curiosity. 

Moreover, many companies across industries in China, especially tech companies are taking action to build their in-house capability to mine their goldmine, and deploying an army with relevant skills is one essential part of it. 

Data scientist is probably one of the most significant roles in the this squad. 
- They provide required not only technical but business expertise  
- They lead project to drive measureable changes 
- They speak the new language of data, insinuating a more data-driven culture to be 

**How does data scientist work in China?**

__Data Scientist is Not One Guy.__ The fact that more and more tech companies in China start to value and use data, has indeed changed how they hire data talents. As a matter of fact, current job market is fully filled with all sorts of data-related positions, but sadly enough, no or very few data scientist. 

The truth is, tech companies in China normally would just hire different people who specialize on one or two data skills, say ETL, and he/she is then the go-to guy when it comes to that specific data task. 

The occasion where one is able to participate in every step throughout a data project to do whatever have to be done like a data scientist is very rare. In china's tech companies, __Engineer is engineer, analyst is analyst.__

__Data Scientist Shouldn't Be "Dumb".__ Data scientists are special, to a degree because they have access to all the company's data, and authority to make decisions or are able to directly influence the decision-maker (like stakeholders). In China, usually the case is that you either do not have access to the data, or it is very difficult or time-consuming to obtain the data; the impact is minimum because you cannot reach out to the executives and will not be heard.

Disciplines crossing one another really goes a long way towards the development of data science, and I think in order to garner its full benefits, companies have to trust their people and let them grow to become real data scientists.
