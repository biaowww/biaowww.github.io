In the world of finance, profound math is probably of the least concern. Unless impossible, people care to approach  problems in simple ways with a *sound logic*. Though, finance deals with numbers, we don't see lines of mathematic equations, or as sophisticated methodology as physics in finance. See [here](http://www.wallstreetoasis.com/blog/do-i-need-math-for-finance) how differennt math works out in finance.

The very first time I was exposed to finance, I thought I had no difficulty in [financial equations](http://www.algebra.com/algebra/homework/Finance/FINANCIAL-FORMULAS-101.lesson). The hard part, however, is understanding the essences and making sense of them. Before uncertainty, really is where financial thinking comes to play.
and I start to appreciating the beauty of finance. Here I have created two projects.

Project 1 is just to put aside $1000, naturally it is still $1000 at the end of Year 2; Project 2 represents the scenario where to deposite $1000 in a bank and withdraw in two year with a 5% interest rate. While it is human intuition to be in favor of Project 2, I want to dive deep into the both. Why do we need two projects here, and how to carry out the evaluation?

- __Takeaway#1__: Value (creation) is relative: e.g., use Project "interest rate" __r<sub>1</sub>__=0.00 to evaluate Project 2 and vice versa.  
- __Takeaway#2__: [Internal rate of return](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_rate_of_return) of a project itself is its interest rate: e.g., the IRR of Project 2 is __r<sub>2</sub>__=0.05.
