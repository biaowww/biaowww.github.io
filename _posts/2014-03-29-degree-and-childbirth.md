Delayed childbearing has quickly become a phenomenon nowdays, and it is due to various reasons one of which is very likely education. So how much impact has people's highest degree on their choice of age for their first child? It is probably not as that dramatic as you think.

*Our data comes from General Social Survey (GSS) data set of residents of the United States from 1972-2012. While records do not exclusively address the recenet decade, they do show relationship between the two.*

Apparently, people with higher degree tend to bear their first child at later age. It makes sense people who stay at school longer tend to postpone this time. However, average age at first birht shifts right by about only __1 year__ from 21 to 27 as degree level ranges from the lowest to the highest. 

It is not like people with higher degree have shockingly postponed the time for their first baby.But as a very intricate problem, to fully understand it requires much more work. And what should we do? I don't know, tell me about it...
